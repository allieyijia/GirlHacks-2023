For GirlHacks hackathon 2023 

Built with Python and Streamlit

## Inspiration ##
We wanted to make something space themed, and one of our teammates wanted to create a planet simulation! They were inspired by the vscode pets extension, and although we didn't know much about app extensions, we could create a website to mimic the job!

## What it does ##
This app allows you to run a simplistic planet simulation. You can feed your planet elements to change its archetype, spawn asteroids and potentially create moons, and view realistic statistics about your planet!

## How we built it ##
We used Streamlit to create our web application. In terms of libraries, we used matplotlib, random and pandas.

## Challenges we ran into ##
Using the matplotlib library in Streamlit was quite difficult. We also wanted to add a dynamic timer for age, but it was unfeasible (we still have age; it just doesn't dynamically change).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ##
This was our first hackathon, and we didn't really know that much. However, we planned very well! We also believe that we did a great job doing defensive coding (checking to make sure that no edge cases throw errors).

## What we learned ##
We learned a lot about Python in general! We also learned about the basics of web development (although we didn't really split our frontend and backend).

## What's next for Tinyverse ##
We would like to add asteroid animations, and we'd also like to decorate the planet more based on its archetype (opposed to just the color; this may also require animations as well).
